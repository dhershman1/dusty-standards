# Configs

This is where a list of eslint configs will be kept.

To use one of these configs you can:

- Clone the repo
  - Grab the config you want and put it into your project
  - Remove everything before the `.eslintrc` portion of the file name
- Copy and Paste the config of your choice from here directly into your own `.eslintrc` file
