# Standards and Guidelines

This little repo is based around documenting standards and guidelines. Since I am asked to write up documentation like this I figured it'd be nice to have a template hanging around I can make tweaks too based on who evers needs, or possibly for anyone to grab and implement themselves.

Now the bulk of the documentation will flow nicely along with the [StandardJs](https://standardjs.com/) setup. 

There are linter plugins for most editors and you can probably find a plugin for any build tool too. You can start **[here](https://standardjs.com/index.html#are-there-text-editor-plugins)**

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

The idea behind JavaScript Standard Style is to have no "Bike shedding" no config, you install and done. Start coding and it handles the rest. Luckily before adopting this standard I had a strict set of rules that I have kept up with mentally, which I will outline in the documentation.
